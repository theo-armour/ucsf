### Client History

For most of my life I have made a reasonable effort to keep reasonably fit. Having said that, I almost always been overweight, consumed too much alcohol and have done all the usual bad things.

I should point out that being fit has almost always been secondary to other aspects in my life. Occasionally it has been of prime importance, for example, when I've been practicing for a long-distance swim. But it's been mostly short periods of my life. Yes, it would be nice to be not sedentary, but I write software - darn good software - and that mostly requires being fairly still much of the time.

I am moderately disabled - but over the past 50 years have learned to live with my disabilities. The new thing is fecal incontinence.  I self-cath and my urinary incontinence is pretty much under control. Fecal incontinence is a bit more tricky I find. Because of it I have stopped at the swimming in a club pool. And I have also stopped taking Pilates and other exercise classes.

I also stopped the classes and swimming. I also stopped classes for another reason. When I was taking the classes, I reckoned that the classes took care of my exercising for the day. And I would tend to sit for hours in a chair without much movement.

With the advent, few years ago, about the problems of sitting too long, I began to realize that I had to consider the issue of moving multiple times during the course of the day. So I wrote an app that runs on my computer that causes Pandora to run every 18 minutes. When Pandora comes on, I stand up and move around and do something. and I'm getting fairly good but not perfect about moving when the bell rings. I live in an apartment building. My hallway is just about a hundred yards long. if I do nothing else during the course of the day, I try and walk up and down 6 to 9 times a day or 1,000 to 1,800 yards a day.

I have tried a number of tricks to keep track of my movements. Simple pedometer, Fitbit devices and others. Currently I am relying on my Google phone and Google Fit app. As last I am beginning to be happy with the record-keeping. But I'm sure this could be more and better. What I would really enjoy is somebody to talk to to share the observations and monitoring new developments.
