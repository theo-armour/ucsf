### 2019-02-24

My priority to to be able to document my physical activity without me having to do anything - apart from setting up the system and carrying out occasional maintenance and enhancement.

Things to track might include:

* Steps, distance, times etc
* Other activities: hip-ups? push-ups?
* Weight
* Heartbeat?
* Blood pressure?

Google Fit running on my phone seems to be doing a good. fail-free way. First app I've come accros that does this.


My second priority is to be able to share that data on the web

* Data available via GitHub pages - ie a static host

First step: Can capture historical data from Google Fit and send to a Google Sheet.

The export of data is now at a very early but working! stage. I 've wanted to do something like this for years. Things finally have gotten easy enough for a derp like me to get going. The future should bring more data, more data types and more interesting presentations and reports.

### 2019-02-23

This week
* Over 6,000 steps per day
* Over 60 minutes waking per day
* Over 10 heart points per day
* 10 hip-ups a day when I get up. Sometimes more later
* 10 Pushups a few times - on floor and against counter
* Can get up and out of a chair that is fairly high without using hand or elbow
* Weight is having an issue or two

### 2019-02-21 ~ Theo
