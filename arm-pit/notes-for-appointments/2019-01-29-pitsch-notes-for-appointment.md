## Phase 1 exercises:

To add cardiovascular work to basic calisthenics (think post total hip exercises- elevator squats and leg lifts) increase the speed a little hold on, or add a weight to a backpack). KEEP THE WEIGHT LOW AND DO NOT HOLD YOUR BREATH!!! This will increase the pressure in your abdomen and on your hernia, so don't do it!

Hold off on the recumbent stepper until your pressure injury is healed.

Keep: up the good work by standing every 18 minutes. Use the walker for your cardio walks. Goal: consistency, then increase steps per day. Try to add a few more steps every day

Recommended Daily Allowance of walking- 30 minutes of cumulative activity.

* Talk perhaps every couple of months
* Question about efforts, dilemmas and progress **--- this is the main focus of what we are working on now- how to get your needed exercise given the existing current constraints?**
* Discuss disabilities, aging and how all of that operates and informs the geometry of an aging body
**-- Plan: address current medically necessary deficits in standing up, walking speed, and getting up from the floor under medicare, with long range plan of wellness check-ins that would be self pay.**

* Maintain awareness with fitness-related hardware, software, apps and internet technology.**---"Rock my run" for walking speed.**
* Advise what to install and what to acquire in terms of tools to help you keep fit **---- We agreed , google fit seems to be working well with added pulse oximeter from "uncle Jeff"**

* Collaborate on online documents to record issues and progress
* Collaborate or edit articles to be published online
**----- give me until after March**
* Help devise an exercise regimens that could be useful for the next 10 to 20 or so years. That is to say an exercise program for a sedentary aged disabled person
 **--- see "phase 1" above**

### Job Details / Description

* Certified PT with good clinical experience **--- ahem, licensed Doctor of PT**
* Online meetups via Google Hangouts / Skype whatever online video meetup up service **--- setting up Zoom telehealth now and we will contact you when up and running**
* Online dialog lasting about 20 minutes every 2 months **--- once you are on a long term wellness path. Medicare requires monthly reassessment**
* Perhaps monitoring by camera phone for things such as analysis of gait. Perhaps an actual meet up once a year **-- If I am going to be challenging your gait, I definitely want to be there in person.**
* Help think about new ways of doing things. For example, when walking, what to be thinking about? When concentrating on seat, or knees, or hips, or head and neck or whatever part, what to think about? **---we will talk about this in a future visit, but I try to keep it really, really simple. Walking with mobility challenges takes a lot of concentration, so the simpler the better.**
* Create check lists of 10 things to think about until next session **-- 10 is way too many. Two things- walking and doing calisthenics on your breaks.**
* Payment should be made for this consulting so as to be financially invested in the outcome
* $50 per session would be about a reasonable sum to pay for access to the expertise **-- health and wellness cash pay rates are $75-80 for 30 min-- but that's a way off for now.**
* All funds payable by PayPal or Venmo or some other respected online system **--- not sure about that yet.**
* Tap into any help Medicare may offer **-- initial plan to work on above listed problems for 3 months.**
