_What's happening currently_

## Current targets

### Walking

* Currently 5,000 steps per day
* 20 'heart minutes' per day
* 45 minutes of movement per day

Weight
* currently 87/88 kg
* Medium term: get back down to 84 kg - my weight before Thanksgiving
* Longer term: 80 kg

### Current devices/monitors

Google Fit app
Google Pixel 3 XL Phone monitors walking
Fit-Index app and ES-26M scale monitor weight, BMI etc

Standalone/unconnected
$10 pulse oximeter - nice but no wifi

I like the Fitbit but lose/put in washing machine too often/has issues connecting
Current level of drive
Very much in a 'don't break the chain' mode with my walking
May or may not be good
Need to add some non-walking moves

_What's wanted in the future_

## Building a ongoing coach/player effort

### Standing agendas for online meetups
* What are the things we should discuss?
	* Effective communication
* Written, online, collaborative
	* Tools: groups.io? github?
* Fees/Scheduling/Insurance
	* Can this work within existing frameworks?
	* Or do we create new non-sickness-plan ways of collaborating?

_What to plan for_

### Before exercising / Planning / Signalling

* Building up to a list of daily exercises/movement routines
	* For the next 5/10 years?

* Better ways of signaling the time for doing something
	* Too easy to ignore the bell

### While Exercising
Things to think about while I am walking up and down the hall
Standing up straight, stretching neck, squeezing handles hard etc

### After exercising

* Android app so I can share Google fit data with family and friends
* Fast and easy ways of keeping data and reporting progress
