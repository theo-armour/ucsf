## Concept

### Issues / Problems
<!--

The general format is an adaptation of the ideas developed in Alexander's _et al_ [A Pattern Language]( https://books.google.com/books?id=hwAHmktpk5IC&pg=PR10#v=onepage&q&f=false ) - as sammarized on page 10.

Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.

patterns are descriptions of common problems and proposal for the solutions that can be used repeatedly every time the problem is encountered and producing an different outcome.

-->

_The development of the overall concept is still at an early stage. The following are some preliminary notes/thoughts._

There's a zillion images of other people's anatomy, but you want to see the images of *your* anatomy.

There's a ton of anatomy tools for the well funded professional, but few tools for the penniless gifted amateur.

Beauty is not skin deep. What's inside may well be even more beautiful that what's outside.

Diseased parts of your anatomy have their own beauty.

How can you access this beauty?

How can you internalize what's going on inside you?

"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science." -Albert Einstein

One of the most surreal, intangible things in life is what is going on inside you right now.

Let's help you get a better handle on this.

***

The outside of the human body is seen as a work of art in countless ways

But what about the inside of the body?

The artist work with

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimesis
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diegesis
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratext

MatLab, _Grey's Anatomy_ and the GE Revolution CT scanner do not jump out at you as tools that artist can use readily

Can we somehow spread out your innards over the artist's mixing tray, and have this palette give rise to new works of art?

***

And it's free. And works on your phone or tablet.

Nothing to download or install.

It just works.

### Mission
<!-- a statement of a rationale, applicable now as well as in the future -->

* To create 3D tools for anatomy visualization that beginner coders can use
* To create 3D anatomy software tools that could be useful at hackathons, maker fairs and tech shops
* To build everything as free, open source software


### Vision
<!--  a descriptive picture of a desired future state -->

* To enable an artist to see what the physician/radiologist/expert has not seen



## To Do / Goals / Up Next

There's a lot more in the works

<!--

### CT Scan Files / The Abdomenal FlowMan

I have yet to receive a CD ROM with the DICOM files of my recent scan. Once I have these, I should be able to recreate a 3D viz.
See also the 'Brain of Richard' app. But now augmented with five years of added experience and improved tools
