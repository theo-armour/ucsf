The Status of Illness in the age of Social Networks

Starts with drawing on the thoughts of Walter Benjamin in'The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'.

I am not an academic. But I can track a existing thought process or analysis and see if thee can be similar conclusions drawn elsewhere

The story line of Romeo nd Juliette has been recast and reimagined many times.


How to be ill in the modern era?

# Observations


People will tell you how they are/feel. There's is no need to ask how anybody is, or even to have to remember to ask
-In the old day you migh mark on your calendar that sombody is have a test or procedure so yoou would rember to check in

Prayers, best wishes, hopes for a speedy convelesance, fingers crossed: a dime a dozen

Is the way to getting more 'likes' is to be more ill.

When you are dead you may not be able to like somebody's post, but you can still follow them. Even if thety are dead as well.

The more you know, the more people ask you to explain things to them

## Age brings demonetization

Annual US Health care expenses have passed 3 trillion dollars this year.
Often creating a crushing burden on people.
Before going on Medicare my insurance and copyays were in the range of $25,000 year

Now that I am on Medicare the insurance has f=drpped below $10,000.

But the striking thing is that any mention of money and paying for stuff has eveporated.
It's as if I had move to Europe = or any normal country where medical costs are borne by the society.



## Part I / Ubiquity of procedures

Medical procedures as a product of factories - mechanically reproduced operations

* 'brought into our house from far off'

'the art of the film' is like the 'action at a distance' using endoscopy



## Part II

Benjamin says:

> Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element:
> its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.


Similarly the meds, the treatments, the procuders may be the same, but each illness has its own vemu and circumstance


We can grow the diseased tissue on a Petri dish, and do stuff we can do wuth the in situ disease

Fun question: What is the 'aura' of an illness - a cancer in particular?

reproduction creates plurality and transmittablity

Illness ditto but less control over transmittability


## Part III

> The adjustment of reality to the masses and of the masses to reality is a process of unlimited scope,
> as much for thinking as for perception.

Ditto Illness
