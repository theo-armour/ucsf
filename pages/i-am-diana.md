# I am Diana :
# a manifesto for
# aged, disabled wild things

_Started by Theo on Christmas morning 2016. Title draws from ‘I am Charlie’ or ‘Je suis Charlie’ which in turn draws from ‘Ich bin ein Berliner’ and ‘I am your savior’ and more. Content draws on the manifesto that everything should have a manifesto - including your life._


I am Diana. We are Diana. Diana is us.

I am one of the millions who does not wish to die a sad, lonely painful death

I want to be with people, go to parties, talk about politics/religion/sex

I don’t want to be stuck in a room all day with peeps that can’t seem to hear what I really want to say.

I want be beautiful and help others develop their beauty

I want to know what is going on

I want to be part of the process that decides who I am, where I live and what I do.

I want to see children, pet kittens and pat puppy dogs. I want to be part of life as it is now lived.

I am willing to bear a lot of pain sometime and a little pain all the time. But a lot of pain all the time is beneath my dignity.

I am willing to exercise, better myself and look after myself except when I am in too much pain.

First help me reduce my pain, then help me reduce my meds. Just don’t try it the other way.

When my life get dicey, don’t just throw me overboard - but then again don’t go overboard in keeping me spicy.

The world will be a lot more fun when everybody is as rich and smart and as beautiful as I am. In the meantime, I love to be very generous with my money when spent on beautiful things, excellent food and delightful experiences. But that does not mean I want to waste money

I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth (along with all the other things my parents shoved into me ;-) It would be a nice thing if I could leave the world with giving as much silver as I received.

I am not a carcass to be delivered to the lowest bid care-giver.

I am not something you are supposed to visit twice a year.

I am not an item on a receipt.

I am the future you.

### _I Am the Walrus_

The Beatles

I am he as you are he as you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm crying

Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation T-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob

Mr. City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run
I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying, I'm crying

Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down

I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus
Goo goo g' joob
Sitting in an English garden
Waiting for…
