## Cereals

### Kelloggs Cereal All Bran Bran Buds

* Bran Buds have a taste similar to cardboard. I used to add dried cranberries but they stick to teeth and I’m not much of a sweet thing eater. Salsa to the rescue.
* 2 to 3 ounces
* 13 gm fiber ~ has been very helpful with regulating bowel movements - but always looking for good new ideas

It almost tastes OK.

## Notes

### 2017-08-26

Rotate between cereals

### How to add diversity?

* Parmesan cheese as flavor enhancer?
* Go back to adding dried cranberries
* What fresh fruit or veggie could I add
	* Excellent shell life
	* Consumable in small quantities without spoilage even if packaging is unsealed
	* etc (ie Theo would actually put this into long term practice ;-)
	* Baby toms? but I already get so much tom from salsa
